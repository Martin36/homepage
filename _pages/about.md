I am Martin Funkquist, currently a PhD student at Link√∂ping University. My research is within the field of AI, with a focus on sequential decision making and learning. I am interested in creating autonomous agents that can autonomously learn how to act in a complext environment. Our current approaches involve combining Deep Learning and Symbolic AI that can learn symbolic models of the world, which can be used for planning and decision making.
